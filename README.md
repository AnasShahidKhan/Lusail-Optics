### About The Project

This project is a static website built from the ground up to establish a digital presence for Lusail Optics. The goal was to create a clean, modern, and fully responsive site that provides key information to customers, including services, location, and contact details.

This project was built as part of my personal portfolio to demonstrate front-end development, project management, and UI customization skills.
